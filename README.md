# spark-example

This repository contains a sample Spark job in Python. The script demonstrates:

1. Reading data from a CSV file into a Spark DataFrame.
2. Performing a simple transformation (grouping by the Age column and counting).
3. Optionally running a user-provided SQL query on the data (via Valohai parameters).
4. Writing the transformation and optional SQL results to disk.
